# scansio-sonar-splunk

The goal of this project is to make it possible for security researchers, threat intelligence analysts, and security operations teams to take advantage of the [Internet-Wide Scan Data Repository](https://scans.io) study data using Splunk. The tools included here download, parse, and enrich scan study data before loading it into Splunk for analysis. 

This project is inspired by the excellent work by [Mark Parsons](https://github.com/mpars0ns). Our goal is to extend upon the tools and techniques that Mark has pioneered. Significant portions of the code in this repository are copied with permission from Mark's [scansio-sonar-es](mpars0ns/scansio-sonar-es)

This project focuses on the use of [Splunk](https://splunk.com) as the analysis platform for large scale Internet scan data. Splunk is a commercial product, and the creators of the project are Splunk employees. You will need to arrange for proper Splunk licensing in order to use this project. Some uses of this project are supported by the Splunk Enterprise Trial license and/or Splunk Free edition.

## download.py
download.py retrieves the files associated with a particular study available at https://scans.io. This script downloads the files and stores them locally. Other scripts in this repository are reponsible for parsing, enriching, and loading the files into Splunk. This project currently focuses on the "SSL Certificates" (sonar.ssl) and "HTTPS (TCP/443)" (sonar.https) studies, however download.py can be used generally to download any of the available studies. Integrity of the downloaded files is validated using a checksum. If a file has already been downloaded, and the checksum matches, it will not be downloaded again. download.py can use Python multi-processing to parrallelize the download process. download.py is often a long-running process so we recommend using screen. download.py does not have built-in safegurads to prevent filling up the disk. Use the --liststudies option to plan accordingly.

### Summary of options:

```
$ python ./download.py -h
usage: download.py [-h] [--downloadpath DOWNLOADPATH] [--verbose]
                   [--liststudies] [--study STUDY] [--listurls] [--listfiles]

  --verbose             Show verbose status information. (default: No)
  --liststudies         Print a list of available studies and immediately
                        exit. (default: No)
  --study STUDY         Download files from this study. Use --list to view
                        list of studies. Takes either uniqid or quoted Short
                        Description. (default: SSL Certificates)

                        view list of studies. Use --study to specify a study.
  --listfiles           List fully-qualified data file locations for this
                        study. This option does NOT check to see that the file
                        exists. Use --list to view list of studies. Use
                        --study to specify a study.
  --poolsize POOLSIZE   Number of processes to spawn. (default: 1)
  --studysize           Return the current size of this study on the scans.io
                        server. Use --study to specify a study.
```

### View the list of available studies

Use the --liststudies option to list the studies available at https://scans.io. The script downloads https://scansio/json and parses it for convenient display. The output contains the name of the study as well as the unique identifier (uniqid) and the estimated size of the stufy files in gigabytes. The example below is a point in time (12/28/2017). You should download the script and run it yourself to view the most current output.

```
$ python ./download.py --liststudies

### Install dependencies
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install [George Starcher's Splunk HTTP Event Collector Python class](https://github.com/georgestarcher/Splunk-Class-httpevent). `pip install git+git://github.com/georgestarcher/Splunk-Class-httpevent.git`

### Download a study
The following example downloads the "SSL Certificates" study files from scans.io, using 16 worker processes, and storing the results under a directory named /sonar/sonar.ssl. Again, we recommend using screen(not shown below) for long running command line processes like this one.

```
$python ./download.py --verbose --study sonar.ssl --downloadpath /sonar --poolsize 16
```

## Load SSL Certificates (sonar.ssl) data
### Prerequisites
1. Download sonar.ssl data using download.py as described above.
2. Prepare a Splunk instance with enough processing power and storage to handle the study data. Create an index and an HTTP Event Collector(HEC) key.
3. Download latest Maxmind GeoIP Database
```
$ mkdir geoip
$ sh ./update_geoip.sh
```

### Load Certificates
```
python ./loadcerts.py --downloadpath <path to sonar.ssl study data> --poolsize <number of parallel processes> --hec_key <http Event Collector token configured in Splunk>  --splunk_indexer <IP or Hostname> --splunk_index <index name> --splunk_sourcetype <sourcetype>
```

### Load host/certificate observation data
```
python ./loadhosts.py --downloadpath <path to sonar.ssl study data> --poolsize <number of parallel processes> --hec_key <http Event Collector token configured in Splunk>  --splunk_indexer <IP or Hostname> --splunk_index <index name> --splunk_sourcetype <sourcetype>
```

## Load HTTPS (TCP/44) (sonar.https) data
### Prerequisites
1. Download sonar.https data using download.py as described above.
2. Prepare a Splunk instance with enough processing power and storage to handle the study data. Create an index and an HTTP Event Collector(HEC) key.


### Load HTTPS GET response data

# Python version
All scripts were developed and tested using Python 2.7.x. A conscious, though admittedly somewhat painful, decision was made to avoid Python 3 becasue portion of this code may someday be integrated more tightly into Splunk (e.g. as a modular input), and splunk does not currently support Python 3. 

# Contributions
This code was created as a research project, and thus has some rough edges. Pull requests are welcome!
